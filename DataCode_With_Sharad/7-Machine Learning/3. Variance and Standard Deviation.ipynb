    "These measures provide insights into the spread or variability of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - The variance measures how much the values in a dataset deviate from their mean.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "   - Sensitive to outliers, the variance can be influenced by extremely large or small values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Formula:**\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Variance} (\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "   - It provides a measure of how spread out the values in a dataset are.\n",
    "   - Commonly used for describing the variability of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Formula:**\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Standard Deviation} (\\sigma) = \\sqrt{\\text{Variance}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- **Variance:**\n",
    "  - Useful for understanding the overall variability in a dataset.\n",
    "  - Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "  - Provides a more interpretable measure of spread compared to variance.\n",
    "  - Commonly used for describing the variability of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation Steps:**\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\)) of the dataset.\n",
    "2. Subtract the mean from each individual observation and square the result.\n",
    "3. Sum up all the squared differences.\n",
    "4. Divide the sum by the number of observations to get the variance.\n",
    "5. Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.\n",

    "In summary, variance and standard deviation offer insights into the variability of a dataset. The choice between them depends on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis.\n",
