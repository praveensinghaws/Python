    "**Mean, Median, and Mode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures of central tendency offer insights into the center or typical value of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean:**\n",
    "   - The mean, or average, is calculated by summing up all dataset values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "   - Sensitive to outliers, the mean can be influenced by extremely large or small values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Median:**\n",
    "   - The median represents the middle value of a dataset when ordered from smallest to largest.\n",
    "   - For datasets with an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "   - Less sensitive to extreme values compared to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Arrange data in ascending order and find the middle value(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:**\n",
    "   - The mode is the value(s) that appear most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "   - Datasets may be unimodal (one mode), multimodal (multiple modes), or lack a mode if all values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Identify the value(s) with the highest frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - Suitable for symmetrical distributions without extreme values.\n",
    "  - Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - Useful with skewed distributions or datasets containing outliers.\n",
    "  - Provides a better representation of the center in such cases.\n",
    "- **Mode:**\n",
    "  - Commonly applied to categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "  - May not be applicable or useful for continuous data with a wide range of values.\n",
