    "\n",
    "*  Python works on different platforms windows mac Linux raspberry ios etc.\n",
    "*  Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language\n",
    "*  Python has syntax that allows developers to write programmes with fewer programming languages    lines then some other.\n",
    "*  Python runs on interpreter system meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written This means that prototyping can be  very quick.\n",
    "*  Python can be treated in a procedural way on object oriented way or a functional way good to know\n",
    "*  The most recent major version of python is python 3 which we shall be using in this tutorial However, python 2 although not being updated with anything other than security updates it is Quite popular.\n",
    "####  Python syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "*  Python was designed for readability and has some similarity to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "*  Python uses new lines to complete a command as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parenthesis.\n",
    "*  Python relies on Indentation using white spaces to define scope such as the scope of the loop functions and classes Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
    "####  Example: print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "  Hello world\n",
    "\n"
